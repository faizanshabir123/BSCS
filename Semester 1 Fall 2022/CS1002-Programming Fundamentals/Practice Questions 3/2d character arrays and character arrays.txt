2D character array and character array
Given a 2-Dimensional character array and a string, we need to find
the given string in 2-dimensional character array, such that individual
characters can be present left to right, right to left, top to down or
down to top.
 
a ={
{D,D,D,G,D,D},
{B,B,D,E,B,S},
{B,S,K,E,B,K},
{D,D,D,D,D,E},
{D,D,D,D,D,E},
{D,D,D,D,D,G}
}
str= "GEEKS"
2
a = {
{B,B,M,B,B,B},
{C,B,A,B,B,B},
{I,B,G,B,B,B},
{G,B,I,B,B,B},
{A,B,C,B,B,B},
{M,C,I,G,A,M}
}
str= "MAGIC"

– Traverse matrix character by character and take one character as string start 
– For each character find the string in all the four directions recursively 
– If a string found, we increase the count 
– When we are done with one character as start, we repeat the same process for the next character 
– Calculate the sum of count for each character 
– Final count will be the answer
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              

Given a string of lowercase characters, the task is to count the number of substrings of starting with character X and ending with character Y.
 
str = "abbcaceghcak"
x = 'a', y = 'c'
5
abbc, abbcac, ac, abbcaceghc, aceghc

str = "geeksforgeeks"
x = 'g', y = 'e'
