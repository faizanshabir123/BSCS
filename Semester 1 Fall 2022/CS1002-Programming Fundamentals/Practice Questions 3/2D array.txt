Write a menu driven C++ program to do following operation on two
dimensional array A of size m x n. You should use user-defined
functions which accept 2-D array A, and its size m and n as arguments.
The options are:





To input elements into matrix of size m x n


To display elements of matrix of size m x n


Sum of all elements of matrix of size m x n


To display row-wise sum of matrix of size m x n


To display column-wise sum of matrix of size m x n


To create transpose of matrix B of size n x m




       
 Write user defined functions for square matrix to calculate Right diagonal sum






 Write a user-defined function in C++ to display the multiplication of
row element of two-dimensional array A[4][6] containing integer.




 Write a user defined function named Upper-half() which takes a two
dimensional array A, with size N rows and N columns as argument and
prints the upper half of the array.


e.g.,


2 3 1 5 0                              2 3 1 5 0


7 1 5 3 1                                 1 5 3 1


2 5 7 8 1   Output will be:       1 7 8


0 1 5 0 1                                       0 1


3 4 9 1 5                                          5




    Write a function in C++ which accepts a 2D array of integers and
its size as arguments and displays the elements of middle row and the
elements of middle column.


[Assuming the 2D Array to be a square matrix with odd dimension i.e. 3x3, 5x5, 7x7 etc...]


Example, if the array contents is


3  5  4


7  6  9


2  1  8


Output through the function should be :


Middle Row : 7 6 9


Middle column : 5 6 1






   Write a program to add two array A and B of size m x n.

   Write a program to multiply array A and B of order NxL and LxM  
8. 

Write a program to sort 2D array
