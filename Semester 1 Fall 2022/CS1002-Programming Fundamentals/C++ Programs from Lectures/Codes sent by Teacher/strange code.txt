cout << ++x << " " << x++ << " " << x++ << endl << endl;


As your statements are evaluated, they are undefined, as is the effect of your code.
Even if it seems to happen from right to left in your particular examples, you should not rely on that.

Code blocks will give you a diff result and a VS code diff. Different compiler, different results.

The solution to your problem is:


 Never write code that results in undefined behavior! :)
