//We need to explore all the paths but only till first 4 edges
// after exloring all the paths till first four edges, if we have reached our destination then we increment number of
// routes otherwise we dont
// to explore all the paths we need to aplly DFS starting from the source
// The source will call DFS for all its adjecent nodes and those adjacent nodes will call DFS for all their adjacent nodes and so on until 4 edges are complete in each path
// since every node can be connected to every other node say v no of nodes
// so for source there will be v dfs calls and for each of those calls, there will be v more calls and so on till 4 edges have been complete
// so the time complexity will be (V)^4 where V is the number of vertices

//Q2

//If the deleted edge is not in the MST then no need to update the MST
// else the MST has been divided into two connected components
// if edge (a,b) is removed then vertex 'a' belongs to one connected component and vertex 'b' belongs to the other connected component
// we are to connect these to components back together and covert them into a single connected component
// find all vertices in the component to which vertex 'a' belongs
// find all vertices in  the component to which vertex 'b' belongs
// now take difference of set E and E'
// this will give us the edges that belong to the original graph but not the MST
