Dear students
Please note the following points about your project:
- The company looks at hours, not days. For example, it is fine if an employee completes 40 hours in the first four
days and does not appear on the next day!

- Although an employee can file the casual-leave application after the leave period, she will get the hours only
when her supervisor approves the application!

- The system shall generate two separate reports for hours and leaves: One report shows the employees whose 
total working hours are less than 80 percent. While other report lists employees who availed leaves without
 approval/application

Good luck!
