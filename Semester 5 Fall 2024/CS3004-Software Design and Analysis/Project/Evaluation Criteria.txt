Assalam o Alaikum, 
Hope youâ€™re all feeling great.
The evaluation criteria for the Attendance and Leave Management System Project are divided into two main
components: 70% of the marks are based on adherence to Software Design Principles and the application of
appropriate design patterns, such as Factory Method, Strategy, and Observer, to ensure scalability, flexibility, and
maintainability. The remaining 30% of the marks are for the working project functionality, ensuring that all
requirements are met.
Below, you will find the detailed criteria, along with suggestions on the patterns and methods that can be followed to 
make your job a little easy and create a well-structured project.
