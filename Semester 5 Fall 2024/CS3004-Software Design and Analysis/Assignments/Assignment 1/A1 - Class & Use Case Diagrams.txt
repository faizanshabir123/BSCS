A1 - Class & Use Case Diagrams

Q1) Give a class diagram for the following Election Management System. Show classes, inheritance and associations.
 You may include a few data members or member functions for each class. However, you are not required to write each
 and every attribute or method.
 The Ootumlia Elections Commission is designing a system to manage elections. The system will manage elections for
 a variety of different elected bodies (e.g. school boards, city councils, etc.). Each elected body can have various
 positions (also called seats, e.g. mayor, councillor, etc.). Elections are scheduled for a specific date, and usually
 several (or all) positions are voted on together; however, sometimes there may be the need for a by-election (e.g. to
 elect a particular councillor because the incumbent – the previous person who held the position – has resigned). 
 The system will keep track of candidates for each seat. The system will also record who is the incumbent for a seat, since
 newspaper reporters are interested in reporting whether incumbents have won again or lost. The system records the
 name and address of each candidate and incumbent. The system will also keep track of the list of eligible voters. Each
 voter can only vote for certain positions (e.g. a particular council seat that represents their area). Each voter is also
 assigned to vote at a specific poll – each poll has a number and is located in a polling station. The system records the
 name and address of each voter. Finally, the system will keep track of the number of votes for each candidate at each
 poll. However, under no circumstance will it record which voter voted for which candidate, nor whether a voter voted at 
 all
